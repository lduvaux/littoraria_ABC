- think to transform the observed data as well!
- three steps in the ABC:
    - simulations
    - compute PLS
    - ABC
        - including the transfor of teh stats using the PLS

Need to:
    - optimize transformation using 'transformer'
        - require a script to format stat file to 'transformer' input in the fly
